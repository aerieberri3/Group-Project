This is a file added to my repository - I am looking to make a branch.
I added one branch for each person in our group - We have Ivan Alvarado,Mike V
 ,Damaris Soto, and Erin Schofield
Our project is going to compare Sharpe and Sorino Analysis 
We will be using Daily Returns from SP500 stocks
We will source data individualy and then come together to review our techniques  - each member is responsible for 2 data sets, each set to be a unique stock
