This is a file added to my repository - I am lookng to make a branch.
Created my notebook to analyze two different cryptocurrencies for a potential client looking to hire financial advisors. 
Imported all the programs needed to read in all data and create data and charts. 
Used api.alternative.me to get url's needed for two currencies. 
Read in csv files, created dataframes for both coins, cleaned them up as needed and combined them. 
Plotted combined closing outputs. 
Evaluated risk for each coin seperately, plotted as box plots, combined the two plots for side by side comparison. 
Calculated annualized standard deviation for coins, and found Sharpe Ratios for the combined data.
